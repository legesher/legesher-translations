## Adding LANGUAGE to the Legesher Translations for Python

Version 1 of Legesher only includes translations for the Python programming language. In order to add this language to the project, complete the steps detailed in [the translation guide](https://legesher.readme.io/docs/translation-guide)

**To complete this issue**:

- [ ] Create LANGUAGE dialect `.yml` file
- [ ] Enter translation for _at least_ the Python keywords
- [ ] Merge changes into branch titled `LANGUAGE-translation` on this repo

### Reviewers Needed

In order to add the translations into our database to use, the translations will need to be approved and accepted by 3 additional native / fluent speakers. If you would like to be one of the reviewers for this language, please mention in this issue and you'll be notified when the review is ready! :smile:
